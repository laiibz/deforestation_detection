# Prediction Functionality Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Backend Route**
- **Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/detect` but no route existed in Express backend
- **Fix**: Added detection route in `routes/protected.js` with proper file upload handling

### 2. **Conflicting Flask Applications**
- **Problem**: Two separate Flask apps (`api.py` and `app.py`) were handling predictions
- **Fix**: Created unified Python prediction script (`model/predict.py`) that can be called from Express

### 3. **Model Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Model file path was incorrect in prediction scripts
- **Fix**: Updated paths to use absolute paths relative to script location

### 4. **Frontend-Backend Response Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Frontend expected different response formats from different components
- **Fix**: Standardized response format across all components

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React) 
    ↓ HTTP POST /api/detect
Express Backend (Node.js)
    ↓ Spawn Python process
Python Prediction Script
    ↓ Load model & predict
Trained Model (deforestation_model_best.pth)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/routes/protected.js`**
   - Added `/detect` route with file upload handling
   - Integrated Python prediction script

2. **`backend/model/predict.py`** (NEW)
   - Unified prediction script
   - Proper model loading and image processing
   - Base64 encoding for response

3. **`frontend/src/components/Detect.js`**
   - Updated to handle new response format
   - Added proper error handling

4. **`frontend/src/components/Segmentation.jsx`**
   - Updated to use new backend endpoint
   - Fixed response handling

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_prediction.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server: `npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd ../frontend && npm start`
3. Navigate to `/detect` or use the segmentation component
4. Upload an image for deforestation detection

## Dependencies

Make sure all Python dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- The prediction now works through the Express backend instead of separate Flask apps
- Authentication is required for detection (uses auth middleware)
- Images are processed and returned as base64-encoded overlays
- Error handling is improved across all components
